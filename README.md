The project it self is a small game where you controll a ball that has the ability to push objects

We have added a Colour Correction/Grading with two colour table the player is able to change thought by push I OR O
this will change the shader for the whole map. Why this was implemented is later on in the coruse project we would 
be use this to make the game harder for the player in later levels. Follow same steps as in the course work but added
the feautre to show which table is being used

Added Rim lighting (Effect Pronunciation, Glow Intensity Control,Seamless Integration) This was implemented for the colour grading
to change how it interacat the with world.

Added Illumination Effects (Created illumination effects through toggles for ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting) This was implemted 
to give better lighting and effects for the not only the course but for the objects as well to give different looks. This will allow us 
to make things harder or easier to see.

Added Normal and Bump Mapping this implemented to give the ball teaxure and then later on the rest of the objects
for the final project. Same way as course material

Explain will be in the video
